% computeSpikeRate.m
%
% Function that takes in vector of indicies for when spikes occured, a
%  timing vector, and a window size to compute the spike rate.
%
% INPUTS:
%   spikeInd - vector of indicies for when spikes occured
%   t - time at each index, in seconds
%   window - size of moving window, in seconds, to compute spike rate over
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   spikeRate - vector of spike rate (same size as t)
